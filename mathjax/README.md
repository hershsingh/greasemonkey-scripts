# MathJax Greasmonkey Script

## Usage
To load MathJax on any webpage and render all the TeX between dollar signs ($..$), just press F4. 

This works in `iframes` as well, which means that you can render TeX inside google chat windows by pressing F4 if the focus is in the chat window. You can use F4 to typeset again, if some new math text has appeared since you last loaded MathJax.
